I wanted to make an android app for fun and thought a cool idea would be to have an app the receives SMS and forwards it to
an program on your desktop and then giving the ability for the user to respond back to from the desktop back
all in background. Something simple to see whats changed since my college courses years ago.
I was thinking about implementing it over TCP connection in the background since it was just going to be an emulator app. 
The long and short of it though is that it wont really work the way I intended it for receiving messages. so I'm currently looking up other ways to handle that.
